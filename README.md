This is the repository for Team Manny's Angels.

Our application is called Health Forecast, and uses an API to synthesize weather data to inform our users when their 
chronic medical conditions may have a flare-up. Currently, we are able to present information on migraines, asthma, 
and arthritis. Our apps to help inform those with these medical conditions to better plan around their symptoms.

We implemented this app using Dart in the Flutter SDK.

Issues we ran into included using the API since the data is from a British source, 
so the data had to be localized in familiar units and proper time zones. We also had issues
with the graphing API and and standardizing the data, which was later resolved.

Currently, our build has functionality for migraines, asthma, and arthritis. If we had more time, we would like to include more medical conditions such as allergies. We would also implement graphs that used more information from the weather and the user. For example, a bar graph showing the amount of migraines a user had over the course of a month. Additionally, we would like to improve our methods of approximation.
